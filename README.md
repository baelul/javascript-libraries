### Link Link: [Genshin Card Page](https://baelul.github.io/javascript-libraries/)

This page has a simple concept; it's a page showcasing different playable characters in the game, along with a few facts about them. I made this not only because I really enjoy this game, but also because I wanted to try out some features I had been learning about in class, specifically the feature where the cards fade into view when scrolling on the screen.
